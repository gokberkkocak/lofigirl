## Example Config file

[lastfm] # optional - choose one or both
username = "username" # will be removed after first run and turned into session_key 
password = "password" # will be removed after first run and turned into session_key

[lastfm_api] #optional for standalone. Normal client uses the server side api key.
api_key = "api_key"
api_secret = "api_secret"

[listenbrainz] # optional - choose one or both
token = "token"

[server] # Standalone would not need this section
