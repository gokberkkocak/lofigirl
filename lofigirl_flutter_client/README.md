# Lofi Girl Scrobbler ðŸŽ§ - Flutter Client

Flutter frontend for the lofigirl server component.

## Get Started

Check releases for the native builds. 

If you want to play around with the git version of the frontend:

```

flutter run
```

To build release version

```
flutter build <platform>
```
